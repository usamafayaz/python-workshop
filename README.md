# Machine Learning and Image Processing Training Project

## Overview
This project was developed during a one-month training workshop focused on machine learning, image processing, and natural language processing. The workshop, led by a professional PhD teacher, covered various topics including cv2 for image processing, Flask for web development, and deep learning techniques using Keras with datasets such as MNIST, Reuters, and IMDB. The project includes applications of CNN and LSTM, with a basic introduction to NLP.

## Features

### Image Processing
- **cv2**: Utilized for various image processing tasks such as blurring and Gaussian filtering.
- **Video Frames Extraction**: Extracted frames from videos for further analysis and processing.

### Machine Learning
- **Deep Learning**: Implemented CNN and LSTM models.
- **Datasets**: Worked with MNIST, Reuters, and IMDB datasets from Keras.
- **Visualization**: Used matplotlib for data visualization and plotting.

### Web Development
- **Flask**: Developed web applications to demonstrate machine learning models.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: cv2, Flask, matplotlib, Keras
- **Deep Learning Models**: CNN, LSTM


this is not a project, this is just training of all these thing prior to our final  year project, Industrial Watch, that is AI project.
