# difference between DB and ML Model
# Ability to perform on Unseen data.
# Flask Server have both of them i.e. DB+ML Model

# Controller Breaks down the heirarchy according to the application data flow.
# Controller contains bussiness logic implementation.

# Model is used to store the relational data of DB.

# View is not necessary for us, we will use react to render the data to user.

# SQLAlchemy ORM just as LINQ -> Object Relational Mapper

# select * from student
# db.query().all()  // Functional Approach

# *Code First // Model is already created, then DB is created automaticlly
# Data First  // DB is already created, then model is created automaticlly
