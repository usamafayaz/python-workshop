# DataSets are collection of images, videos, audio and text. (DS)
# DataSets are of Two types:

# 1. Annotated/labeled => Every Sample has a label with itself.
# Use for training the ML algorithm
# Train Test Data Split
# Training => We provide Sample and their labels.
# Testing => We provide Sample and we expect label.

# 2. Annotated/labeled => Every Sample has a label with itself


# Keras Mnist has 70000 images of hand written digits 0-9
from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Activation

# (train_data,train_lbl),(test_data,test_lbl)

# Neural Network
# Input => Neural Network => Output
# Image => Neural Network => 0-9
# 28x28=784 => Neural Network => 0-9
# Neural Network has weights which keep changing during the training.

# One Dense Layer will connect input layer and hidden layer
# Another Dense Layer will connect hidden layer and output layer
# Activation Layer is required between the two dense layers.
# Brain has Neurons
# A Neuron accumulates all inputs it receives.+
